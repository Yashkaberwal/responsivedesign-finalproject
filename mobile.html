                <h2>History Of Mobile Photography</h2>
                <p> 
                    The first commercial phones with camera started appearing in the year 2000 with resolutions as low as 0.11 MPix and limited storage capability only 10s of photos. But, not all devices supported browsing and wireless electronic sharing, in some cases the user had to plug the phone to a computer via cable and download its photos.But in 2002, resolutions had grown to 0.3 megapixels, the camera phone had reached the U.S. shores, and features such as white balance control, self-time, digital zoom, and various filter effects were making their way into mobile phones.<br> <br>
                    But in 2011, smartphone photography is gradually becoming the most popular form of photo taking with most people using their phone as the primary camera. By 2011 over a quarter of photographs were taken on a mobile phone NDP Group, 2012 and 18% of consumers considered their phone to be their primary camera Consumer Electronics Association, 2012. A more recent study has seen this trend consolidate, with 58% of NA Smartphone photo taking consumers exclusively take photos with their phone in 2013. This, in turn, stimulates photo sharing. For example, when Instagram launched, over 100k people signed up in the one week, and in 2013 over 150M active users were registered.

                <h2>Smartphone Photography in Modern Era</h2>
                <p>
                    Today, we have  come leaps and bounds from those early, grainy photos snapped on flip phones. The most advanced smartphone cameras of 2018 boast dual-camera setups, the ability to shoot in formats like wide-angle or telephoto, and 12-megapixels though it is important to note that, despite common perception, megapixels are not always the most telling metric of a camera's quality.<br> <br>
                    Today's smartphone cameras also include features like low-light functionality, super-fast autofocus, and optical image stabilisation for steady capture. Portrait modes blur the background of a scene, and manual exposure modes allow the photographer to manipulate everything from shutter speed to white balance, focus, and ISO.

                <h3>The Spring Of Computational Photography</h3>
                <p>
                    Computational photography refers to computational image capture, processing, and manipulation techniques that enhance or extend the capabilities of digital photography.
                </p>
                The feautures of computational Photography in modern smartphones are impressive:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Multi image processing:  picture-in-picture dual shot, beautification, best face photo composition, HDR, 3D panorama.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Post production: advanced image filters, occlusion removal, 2D to 3D conversion
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Real time processing: stabilization, de-noising, face and features detection, motion capture.
